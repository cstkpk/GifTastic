# GifTastic

* GifTastic is a web application that allows you to use pre-made buttons or create your own to pull gifs from GIPHY. The topic in the button is the keyword that is used to search through GIPHY. If you want to see gifs related to a topic that doesn't already exist in a pre-made button, you can type your topic into the form, hit search, and your button will appear at the top of the page. Then you can click the button, and gifs related to your topic will populate the browser. 

* To animate a gif, click it once. To pause the gif, click it once again. If you really like a particular gif, give it a double-click to save it to your favorites!

* This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, the GIPHY API, and AJAX.
